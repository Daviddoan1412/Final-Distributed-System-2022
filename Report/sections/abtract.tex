\section{ABSTRACT}
\hspace{0.7cm}This is group 5’s report of the final project, which makes up 40\% of our total results of the “Distributed Systems” course. This course, including the most fundamental parts that we should know about a distributed system namely: TCP file transfer, RPC, MPI…, was led by the enthusiasm of Dr. Tran Giang Son.

\vspace{0.7cm}In this report, we will explain carefully about the system that our team presented in the Presentation and Demo part on Tuesday 22/02/2022: Introduction about the system; Analysis and Design of the system; System implementation; The result we got; and Conclusion of the work.

\vspace{0.7cm}Thank you, Dr. Tran Giang Son, for giving us the chance to access so much valuable knowledge and precious practical sessions about the Distributed systems.
