\section{CONCLUSION \& FUTURE WORK}
\hspace{0.6cm} To sum up, we have succeeded in implementing a remote shell using the network socket (L3 socket) for multiple clients with some basic functions. The server side and the client side can easily connect to each other and the client side can execute some primitive commands on the server side.

\vspace{0.9cm} However, we were not able to create the proper confirmation between the client side and server side. In addition, the messages returned to both sides are not clear enough. There is still a lack of information. For example, from the client side, if the user enters a command line to view a text file, the content of the file is only presented on the server side, not the client sideâ€¦

\vspace{0.9cm} In the future, we would like to add a proper confirmation between client and server, implement more functions so that the clients can interact with the server better. Moreover, we are planning to improve and optimize the source code so that the data returned after any executed command is more informative and easy to handle.
